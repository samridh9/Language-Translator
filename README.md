Steps-

1. Import Statements:
   - The `import` statements at the beginning of the code import the necessary classes from the Google Cloud Translate library and the Java standard library.

2. API Key Setup:
   - You need to replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual Google Cloud API key. This key is used to authenticate your application and grant access to the Google Translate API.

3. Translate Object Creation:
   - The `Translate` object is created using the `TranslateOptions.newBuilder().setApiKey(apiKey).build().getService()` method. This object provides the interface to interact with the Google Translate API.

4. User Input:
   - The program uses a `Scanner` to get user input. The user is prompted to enter the text they want to translate and the target language code (e.g., "fr" for French).

5. Translation:
   - The `translate.translate(text, Translate.TranslateOption.targetLanguage(targetLanguage))` method is called to perform the translation. It takes the input text and the target language code as arguments.
   - The result is stored in a `Translation` object.

6. Display Translated Text:
   - The translated text is obtained from the `Translation` object using `translation.getTranslatedText()`.
   - The program then displays the translated text to the user.

7. Dependencies:
   - If you're using Maven, the necessary Google Cloud Translate dependency is added in the `pom.xml` file.
